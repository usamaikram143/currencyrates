Currency Convertor
So we have build a Currency converor React App. It has been done in a group of two people(Usama Ikram and Abdul Wahab Malik).
It has following components (pages):
- Header: Header is the navigation bar on the top with has routing buttons to navigate to different pages. (Developed by Abdul)
- Home: Home page is just a welcoming page with a nice background picture. (Developed by Abdul)
- Forex: Forex page is using an API get query to get all the forex data and printing it. (Developed by Usama)
- Crypto: Crypto page is using an API get query to get all the current crypto prices and using a table printing on the page, it also shows the logo of the currencies and you can click the logo to go to their website.
- Currency_convertor: This page is also using an API get query to get different rates of currencies and using that we can convert different currencies from one to an other.


Future goals:
- Adding some other information along side just prices of difference currencies.
- Making it look more nicer and eye catching, may be adding some animation.
- Finishing up merging all the code to main and deploying the website.
